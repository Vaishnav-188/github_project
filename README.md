Simple Interest Calculator is a beginner-friendly project developed using Python. It is designed to help users calculate the simple interest based on three basic inputs: principal amount, rate of interest, and time period. This project helps in understanding fundamental programming concepts as well as basic financial calculations used in real life.

The calculator works by applying the standard simple interest formula: Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100. The user provides the required inputs, and the program processes these values to compute and display the simple interest.

This project is useful for students who are learning programming, especially those who want to practice arithmetic operations, user input handling, and logical thinking. It can also be used for academic assignments, mini projects, and basic financial learning purposes.

In the future, this project can be enhanced by adding features such as input validation, a graphical user interface, support for compound interest calculation, or converting it into a web-based application.
